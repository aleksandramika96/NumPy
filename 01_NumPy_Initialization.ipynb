      "    exceptions, such as when code requires very specific attributes of a scalar\n",
      "    or when it checks specifically whether a value is a Python scalar. Generally,\n",
      "    problems are easily fixed by explicitly converting array scalars\n",

      "    The primary advantage of using array scalars is that\n",
      "    they preserve the array type (Python may not have a matching scalar type\n",
